# To do list

Tidy up and annotate code
Stream line (done) and include the spatial filtering into the webcam code
Remove the hard edge effects (done)

Ideas

Add in spatial filtering to webcam code
	- small and large scale emission like in the non-live stream example
	- discrete sampling
	- Probably need to add in options for this

Interactive spatial filtering (long goal)
	- Allow a user to setup a second webcam that will allow them to move antennas around to simulate the discrete sampling. This might be difficult, will probably require opencv image detection to identify where the antennas are placed.
